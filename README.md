Drowsiness and Tailgating Detection App

Team Member: Jiahui Li,  Wenbo Ye, Haoying Wang


This project aims at designing a driver safety app which uses dual cameras on Android phones, mainly focused on drowsiness and tailgating detection. Our app is based on OpenCV and OpenXC, and uses computer vision, machine learning and template matching algorithms. In this app, the front camera is used to detect the driver's face and thus decides drowsiness status, while the rear camera is used to check road conditions and thus decides whether the driver is tailgating or not. The integration both parts is realized by context-based camera switching algorithm, which allows cameras to be intelligently switched and allows each part to be processed independently.
